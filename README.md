# Calculator App

I created a calculator app in order to practice DOM manipulation and my javascript skills. If you need help on your math hamework, feel free to use my application :)

## Running the App

You can open the app by accessing the 'open with live server' option on Visual Studio Code. You can also access the app by clicking on the Netlify link!
